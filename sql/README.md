# Metadata SQL

Preferably performed with Metamanager, but in it's current form this isn't always possible. So, if you must use Ingestlibs Station Lookup, please adhere to the following rules.

1. Have sql reviewed and OK'd before executing. The Ingest channel is a great place for this.
2. If you have new Variables to add to the VARIABLE table, please make sure to make corresponding updates to VARIABLE_API after the variables are officially inserted into the VARIABLE table.
